to further lower the barrier of writing to my blog, I decided to start this devlog thingie. I can just do brain dumps here without even worrying about the structure, title, content, or anything like that...

Well, I actually started this because I am too lazy to create a live programming video feed. I kinda needed to make my development experience feel more interesting than just me typing stuff into a computer ... So, ... This is really unfocused.

In order to make my development experience more interesting, I decided to start this devlog. That's sums it up.
