Since I have an uncanny feeling that my mind will be blown to pieces more in the future, I decided to label this mindblown post with a Roman numeral!

Ehm, in any case!

I am completely ashamed and embarrassed to be standing here today, when after years of iOS development, I finally came to peace with using BaaS solutions, such as [Parse.com](http://Parse.com) and [StackMob](http://stackmob.com).

I was always a thing where you want to do everything through terminal, write your notes in Vim, and yeah... Develop a freakin backend using vanila PHP or similar.

Frankly, I never used Vim professionally. I have recently added to the cheatsheet how to quit the damn thing! But, I did have my "geeky" endeavors managing a server's content through `ftp >` in terminal, or trying to rename two files using bash. Those things are fine, everyone starts somewhere and we love it, that's why we are programmers...

But! When you get thrown out into real life, and start writing software that other people will actually use, you don't want to be satisfying you hobbies all the time! The consequences are indeed severe!! I've been there, I should know...

In my case it was probably ignorance, more than the love of adventure, but I _tried_ to write a user management system in PHP, failed horribly. Worked on my apps backend with vanilla PHP, still regretting ever bit of it...

## Conclusion

It's just that how much I achieved in terms of actual results in just ... _one day!_ is heart breaking, and also encouraging on what's next. Utilizing the tools around us as much as possible to achieve what we want faster... Sounds like the most commonest sense ever, yet here am I, a human, falling into the dark pit, as am sure at least one other guy out there has...
