## Quick Tip

Avoid calling `static` `inline` c functions from swift... Apparently, they will crash when you build for release, because of some optimization or something.

I had two `static` `inline` functions that I was calling from swift, and they worked fine in debug mode, but crashes when running in release mode. The crash I got:

```objc
*** NSForwarding: warning: selector (0x38d6e1) for message 'localizedStringForKey:value:table:' does not match selector known to Objective C runtime (0x2b969ce4)-- abort
```

Weird, but I guess this is just one of those hiccups you get when using a new technology
