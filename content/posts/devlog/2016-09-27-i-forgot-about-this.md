Holy crap, I completely forgot about this devlog `>__<` .. definitely should not have...

I don't remember what the last post was about, but since then, just too many things were worthy of at least dumping here .. Learning new optimization tricks in python thanks to the interview process preparations, Swift 3 changes, Phoenix controllers and HTML forms, and of course, the ordeal with ecto.

Well, I don't feel like writing anymore for now, but should revisit this once something comes up.
