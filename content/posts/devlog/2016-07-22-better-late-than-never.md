Wow, I really should have started doing this since forever ... But you you what they always say:

> Better late than never

I mean, really, so many problems could have been preserved .. I've written a lot of them on white boards, idea paint walls, notebooks, notepads, and even voice notes, lol.

Well, time to get that task from the previous post out of the way, then it's time for munching lunch.
