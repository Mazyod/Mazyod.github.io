No post about the new thing ... Not for a while, at least =/

Tomorrow, GRE exam, then Inteligent Algorithms exam, then organization exam, then Intelligent algorithms project due date, then organization project due date .. All this, one right after the other, with only one day as a break: Friday >_>.

Either ways, At least I have a cool assignment that involves hacking whatsapp >:D (Stolen Emoticon)

Should be an interesting post! Look forward to it! (Hopefully!!)
