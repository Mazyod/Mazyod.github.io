My efforts to actually remember all these terminologies I am coming across on a daily basis are fruitless (Especially these days because I am delving into the world of web development). After some deep thought and consenting with my inner self, I came to the realization that I would be better off writing a blog post about EVERY single new thing I learn about ASAP. Bonus points for you if you read it and discuss it here, since that will help us both cement these terminologies...


So, whenever I write a new blog post regarding a new terminology, the title of the post shall conform to the [following RFC standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6921). To put it simply, the title would conform to the following regex expression: Terminology! `\[.{1,26}\]`. Yeah... That's all! The first terminology of the series is coming up next!
