If you haven't read [the cocos2d-x forums yet](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/forums/6/topics/53206), there has been a radical change to the cocos2d-x github repo. Basically, the team decided to abandon ship! No, they just moved from the `develop` branch to the new, shiny `v3`.

It wasn't that bad of a migration for me. All I needed to do is follow the instructions in the post referenced above, and apply my own patches and changes. One issue was converting `Point` to `Vec2`... I mean... Whatever. Cocos should be renamed to something more meaningful if they aren't gonna use ANY Cocoa conventions!!
