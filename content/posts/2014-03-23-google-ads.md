I don't know who is behind google adsense, but he better realize how bad this algorithm they're running on is... I search about a service called [HelpShift](https://www.helpshift.com/) obviously because I __already heard about it__, and check their website, and leave. Next thing I know, all the ads are showing me help shift!!

I mean, is it really that hard to realize the point of advertising? It's __exposure to new prospects__, not some existing person who already took note of this service! Like seriously, here is what happened:

Le me searching for a good analytics, backend, push notification, ... etc service:

I find a few good services, but non of them really fit my need!

... Hence, decides uncle google to just keep showing me these service that _Do Not Fit My Need!_

As I was feeling frustrated, a glimmer of hope shone in my brainz:

I remembered parse and StackMob, and ultimately went with parse... Without Google getting a dime for my conversion!!

## Conclusion

It seems I started to use this blog as a way to dispel my "ARGGGHHH!!"-ness, so don't nobody take it seriously or personal. I think as long as I am typing things and words, my communication skills should be getting better, to say the least... And I have a history to laugh at later!
