I believe it is about time I announced something about what's making me so quiet and eating my time like crazy, isn't it?

Well, let me try to phrase it in a "wow" way:
Kuwait University - College of Engineering and Petroleum Graduation Project, that is.

Our group of five have decided to choose a very challenging project. It has been a very exciting journey up till now... This journey has came to a very abrupt halt, and switched to being very challenging...

"The Settings Journey" is the journey we'll be taking in the project to implement the user settings, so he can customize the app however way he wishes. Before dwelling into this journey, it was easily realizable that it's gonna be long, tough and head-scratching. Thus, I write this post as some kind of "will" in case I lose my mind along the way or something...

If you are saying, "Dude, it's not a big deal, really..". All I have to say is, I REALLY hope you are right and I am wrong...

So.. Until next time.

P.S: No, information about the project shall not be exposed at this point. Information about the progress, however, shall not be exposed, too. But, what I feel like blogging about would be exposed to some extent :P.
