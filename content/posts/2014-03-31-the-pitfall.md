You know how when we started programming, we used to blame the hardware, the compiler, and all the low-level details for our shortcomings? Well, we hopefully don't do that no more.

Then, we started using libraries and frameworks, and _starting blaming those_ for our shortcomings. Hopefully, we don't do that no more, either (I still fall into that occasionally, though).

I am now guilty of blaming other collaborators in our project for my own shortcomings. I did it so willingly and openly, and I feel ashamed. To brush that away, I came to make a confession and make sure that I move away from that, as well.

If you have no idea what the hell I am talking about, well, all I am saying is that [you are your worst enemy](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/).

(This is just a cryptic message that I will leave for my future self: _If something doesn't make sense, it doesn't mean it's useless. It may be a design flaw._)
