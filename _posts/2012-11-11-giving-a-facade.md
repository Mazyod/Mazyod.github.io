After I graduated in June, I have been laying low for a while, working on various projects. Recently, I started leaving my chambers more often for various reasons, including applying for a job (Finally!), attending events (BarcampKW), and meeting with clients. So? you may ask. Well, it seems most people I meet end up trying to know me through my blog. So, I have to fix my blog!

I have been thinking for a very long time on how I am suppose to provide this proper facade through my blog. So, I spent around 30 seconds thinking! (Usually, my blog posts are spontaneous, but not this one!).
