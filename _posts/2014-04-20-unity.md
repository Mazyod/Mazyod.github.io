Shit is getting real `(⌐■_■)`. I started looking into Unity (again), and this time round, there is no backing out.

There were a lot of flaws in my previous approach to learn Unity. I tried desperately to ignore the editor and code everything, as I would normally do in cocos2d. That caused major nightmares and headaches, and me giving up eventually.

Not anymore. The first thing to master is not C#, but the editor instead. Starting with Unity website's awesome tutorial line up, I think I learned a lot more than I would have if I were to just desperately try to get a game up and running just through code.

With the editor basics out of the way, I think I'll just go ahead and run through the rest of the tutorial for the time being, and then implement a dead simple game from scratch to test what I learned.

## Conclusion

This is a mark in history of when I started taking Unity seriously. I am not sure where it will end, but I sure hope it ends well, since it's taking lots of time learning, and other projects are being delayed because of this `>_<`.
