Dear Future Self,

Please exercise on daily basis. The effects of exercise on my mental health are extraordinary. There is a hard cap on the amount of productivity I can extract from myself without exercising. It also made realize something important, that I won't share here, so trust me, your past self, and ... exercise.

_Future self is yet another series I will be publishing that is just small reminders of tips I want to save for my future self. Please feel free to make use of them._
