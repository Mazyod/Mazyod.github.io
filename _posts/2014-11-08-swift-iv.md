Today, I'll present one of my favorite syntactic sugars in swift:

{% highlight swift %}
var value = array.reduce(0) {
    $0 + Int($1.rect.height)
}
{% endhighlight %}

While trying to sum the result of all the rectangles in an array, I decided to use functional programming. I recalled watching the `$` shorthand somewhere, so I decided to give it a try, and Vo√†la. Can't get better than this.

Let's write the previous code in the verbose form, and break it down:

{% highlight swift %}
var value = array.reduce(0, {
        (total, current) in 
        return total + Int(current.rect.height) 
}) 
{% endhighlight %}

So... There are three important shortcuts:

1. We add the closure outside the method call
2. We get rid of the parameter declaration, and use `$n` instead.
3. We get rid of `return`
