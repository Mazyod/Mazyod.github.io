GAAAAAH!!! I just had to yell it out!

I am over with the hardest parts of my graduation project, over with the toughest finals, and most importantly, I am just furious at myself for not writing for so long! [-__-']

On with the post, the sneak peak! Today, though shalt expose parts of thy project!! (My inner literature just goes nuts when I am excited).

Without further ado .. Let us look at this project!

Islamicaster .. Inspired from all the "caster" applications out there, me and my mates in the project decided to call our project "Islamic - caster", with the c being mutual. And please, it is pronounced ISLAMIC and not IZLAMIC.

So, what's so super cool about this project? Number 1 coolest thing probably is that we were fortunate enough to work with a VERY talented Kuwaiti artist. Sir Ahmad Al-Refaie, whom can be found at Owaikeo.com, is currently employed at Pink Coffee & PR, and these guys were kind enough to take care of the graphics design part of the application! This made us work in full potential on the programming side of the project. Still, the graphics are simply breath taking and "outstounding". (I just made that up, which is a mix of two words that fit that place perfectly. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure these two words out :p).

In my opinion, the second best thing about this project is "Portability". Before you start throwing me with nuts for introducing computer Jargon here, let me clear it out. Thy project shaltÂ  run consistently on **iOS, Mac** and **Android!** YES! (As much as possible). The fact is we have already finished much of the Mac app, and the mobile platforms remain. Point is, we are already on three platforms before going official! Hopefully expanding ever more as the project grows larger with more human resources :p.

**I am not going to say anymore than that! If you would really like to know more about Islamicaster, please come visit us at the Engineering Exhibition! **

The first day will be from 12:30pm - 10:00pm, while the second day will be from 9:00am till 8:00pm :D.
