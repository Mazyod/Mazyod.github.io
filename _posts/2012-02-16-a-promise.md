I thought about making a promise here about a cool upcoming post! Making a promise will make me write it at all costs! (At least that's what I am hoping).

So, what is all the hype about? Well, In-App purchases :D. I'll just write how easy and awesome it is to implement In-App purchases in your iOS app. It seems I'll finally see for myself how good they are, too :P.


#### EDIT:


Might as well do a quick post about Game Center leaderboards! The post is going to be twice as useful :P
