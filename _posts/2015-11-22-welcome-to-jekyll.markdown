## Introduction

I usually start with a short introdiction about the stuff I am going to talk about. This is also where I rant about life stuff.

### Sub-heading

More often than not, I add at least one more sub heading, but that is just the beginning. A lot of times I take it even a step further and dig deeper.

#### TASK LIST

__Also Bold__

Is a heading I really like to use when the content is small enough.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight swift %}
func main() {
    var encode = 45
    print("hello, world!")

    let object = Object(param: encode)
}
{% endhighlight %}
