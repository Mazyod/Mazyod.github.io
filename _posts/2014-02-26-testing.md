# Python Testing

*This post was written after going over [this brilliant writeup](http://pythontesting.net/start-here/). I use some of the code samples presented there, as well.*

## Doctests

The most basic way to test in python is by using doctests. This can be achieved by embedding the tests in the docstring:

{% highlight python %}
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    >>> multiply(4, 3)
    12
    >>> multiply('a', 3)
    'aaa'
    """
    return a * b

{% endhighlight %}




Then, in order to run the tests, we do:




{% highlight bash %}
$ python -m doctest -v 

{% endhighlight %}




**CAVEAT:** We probably want to avoid this, since it has a lost of unpredictable behavior. Not to mention the fact that the tests must be written in files and classes that might not exist yet!! _(Test Driven Development)_

## Unittest





This is the most basic test framework provided with Python’s standard libraries that can actually be considered a testing framework. 





**STEPS:**   

1. Create a python module   

2. Ceate “Test Classes” that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`.    

3. Within the classes, define methods that start with **test**.   

4. _Optional:_ Override the `setUp` and `tearDown` fixture methods.   

5. You run the tests by placing `unittest.main()` in your file.   

6. _OR:_ You can try to let python discover and run the tests using `python -m unittest discover simple_example`.





**EXAMPLE:**




{% highlight python %}
from unnecessary_math import multiply

class TestUM(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        pass

    def test_numbers_3_4(self):
        self.assertEqual( multiply(3,4), 12)

    def test_strings_a_3(self):
        self.assertEqual( multiply('a',3), 'aaa')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

{% endhighlight %}




**CAVEAT:** In python world, what I presented is considered “Too much boiler plate code!”. Other frameworks can be used on top of unittest to simplify the process.

## Nose



**“Nose extends unittest to make testing easier”.** You can get started by creating a file and dumping test functions that start with `test`. That’s it. You can use the default `assert` statements that come with python for the assertions.





**Fixtures:** They are a bit weird. The only useful thing to remember is the use of `setup_module` and `teardown_module` functions, for module level fixtures.





**EXAMPLE:**




    
{% highlight python %}
from unnecessary_math import multiply
 
def setup_module(module):
    print ("setup_module before anything in this file")
 
def teardown_module(module):
    print ("teardown_module after everything in this file")
 
def test_numbers_3_4():
    print 'test_numbers_3_4'
    assert multiply(3,4) == 12
 
def test_strings_a_3():
    print 'test_strings_a_3'
    assert multiply('a',3) == 'aaa'

{% endhighlight %}


Running nose:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nosetests -v test_um_unittest.py

{% endhighlight %}





**CAVEAT:** The biggest caveat, IMHO, is the **lack of ‘memorable structure’**. I can’t remember half the syntax nose imposes! Not to mention that it is an **external library** that I had to download.

## Py.Test





If you ever want to be structured and portable, just go with `unittest`. If that’s not the case, which is more often than not, then `Py.Test` **FTW**.





It is almost identical to `nose`, minus the unecessary clutter. Hence, presenting some examples shall suffice.





**RUNNING PY.TEST:**


{% highlight bash %}
$ py.test test_um_pytest.py

{% endhighlight %}


**EXAMPLES:**


{% highlight python %}
from unnecessary_math import multiply

# module functions
def setup_module(module):
    print ("setup_module")
def teardown_module(module):
    print ("teardown_module")

# Before/After each function
def setup_function(function):
    print ("setup_function")
def teardown_function(function):
    print ("teardown_function")

# Sample test functions
def test_numbers_3_4():
    print 'actual test code'
    assert multiply(3,4) == 12 
def test_strings_a_3():
    print 'actual test code'
    assert multiply('a',3) == 'aaa' 

# Very simple class
class TestUM:
    # Class fixtures
    def setup_class(cls):
        print ("setup_class")
    def teardown_class(cls):
        print ("teardown_class")

    # Method fixtures
    def setup_method(self, method):
        print ("setup_method")
    def teardown_method(self, method):
        print ("teardown_method")

    # Actual test methods
    def test_numbers_5_6(self):
        print 'actual test code'
        assert multiply(5,6) == 30 
    def test_strings_b_2(self):
        print 'actual test code'
        assert multiply('b',2) == 'bb'

{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusion:


I have been convinced by this exercise to use TDD as much as possible, and probably in all future projects! Well, honestly, I still think using it for an iOS app taking it a bit too far, but hey! We can definitely use it for backend development, which is what matters the most now.
