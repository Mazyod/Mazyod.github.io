This is the first post on my Octopress blog! This should be a lot easier to publish and customize than the dreaded wordpress blog... Even code snippets are easily embedded and all... I look forward to that the most. But honestly, by far, the best feature is that the blog is hosted on github as a public repo. That is just beyond awesome.

{% highlight python %}
Just a showcase function
def my_awesome_snippet(params):
    """This is a showcase function"""

    my_list = ['foo', 'bar']
    upper_case = [x.upper() for x in my_list]
    # Let's how the user the result
    print repr(upper_case)

{% endhighlight %}
