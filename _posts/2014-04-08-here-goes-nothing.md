Kuwait Prayer Times app has been approved and is pending developer release... Even after all the rigorous testing, I can't help but get an uneasy feeling about this...

The thing about this update is, as I said, I moved a lot of assets to resource bundle, and that could cause things to weirdly break somehow... 

AAAARGH!! I'll just release it and hope that if anything bad happens localytics or hockeyapp will alert me and allow me to react ASAP.

Here goes nothing!
